# Creating a New Aurora Cluster

!!! note
    If you are familiar with the basic concepts of Amazon Aurora MySQL, and have created a cluster in the past, you may skip this module, by using provisioning the lab environment using the [**lab-with-cluster.yml**](https://[[website]]/templates/lab-with-cluster.yml) CloudFormation template, so the DB cluster is provisioned for you. Skip to [Connecting, Loading Data and Auto Scaling](/modules/connect/).
